what is cancer the chances are high that you already know or will know someone with cancer but how does cancer form and where does it come from it all starts with ourselves our bodies are essentially cell factories the cells in our body normally grow and multiply to form new cells as our body needs them cells can also become damaged and dyed and our body replaces those with new cells through a process called cell division sometimes this process breaks down though and dividing cells acquire DNA variants that may cause them to grow abnormally this growth can lead to cancer cancer is a disease that results when some cells in our body lose important functions this causes those cells to grow out of control and often cluster and cell masses sometimes called tumors damaging DNA variants can cause cancerous tumors to grow in nearly any part of the body for example lung cells that have DNA variants May develop lung tumors potentially leading to lung cancer this pattern holds true for practically every cell in the human body some of these changes can be inherited the vast majority occur spontaneously and are not passed down from generation to generation cancers are dangerous because of the way that tumors grow and spread since cells grow and replicate faster within tumors the chance that damaged cells will accumulate more DNA variants increases this in turn can grow the size and speed of a tumor&amp;#39;s development these features of cancer make it difficult to study as cancer is not just one disease but many collections of DNA variants varying from person to person and organ to organ despite these challenges the research Community remains strong creative and dedicated to finding treatments and more people are surviving cancer than ever before

&amp;quot;Never drank alcohol, never smoked, but still got cancer. How is this possible?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;To understand cancer better, we need to understand
the cells in the human body.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Every day 330 billion
cells of our body die are are replaced.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;When Yuvraj Singh got cancer, when Sanjay Dutt got cancer, he was exercising even
while getting chemotherapy.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is necessary to have this level of dedication
to beat cancer.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Around 42% of the cancer
cases globally are preventable.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;And these are the 5
things you need to do if you want to avoid cancer.&amp;quot; Hello, friends! Cancer is probably the most
feared disease in the world. There was a famous
dialogue in the film &amp;#39;Queen&amp;#39; where the lead
character Rani says, &amp;quot;Gupta uncle got cancer. He never drank alcohol, never smoked, but still got cancer. He should&amp;#39;ve tried
drinking at least.&amp;quot; This Gupta uncle hadn&amp;#39;t
consumed alcohol or cigarettes ever, but he still got cancer. Rani says it would&amp;#39;ve been better
if he consumed alcohol sometime. Obviously, it was
a comedy scene, but many people
actually think like this. People might know someone who never even touched
alcohol or cigarettes, but still got cancer. How is this possible? On the other hand,
there are many people who spent their lives
smoking and drinking, but never contracted cancer. Friends, the truth is that cancer is a complex topic. There is no doubt that drinking alcohol increases
the risk of 7 types of cancer. Like liver cancer,
breast cancer, oesophagus cancer, etc. And smoking increases the risk of
16 different types of cancer, including lung cancer, mouth cancer, throat
cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. But, there aren&amp;#39;t only
16 types of cancers. There are more than
200 types of cancer, depending upon the
body part it starts in. So, alcohol and
smoking are definitely two of the major
reasons behind cancer. But there are many other
reasons for cancer apart from these. What are the reasons which you can eliminate to reduce
the risk of getting cancer? How does this
disease work exactly and why is it so
harmful to humans? In today&amp;#39;s video, let&amp;#39;s understand
cancer in depth. A young child named Chirag, went through a routine checkup. It was found that his
haemoglobin level was low. A test revealed that Chirag has a blood disorder
called Thalassemia Major. &amp;quot;It was a random test, by which we came to know that he is Thalassemia Major. And then life took a turn.&amp;quot; Because of this, the
body is unable to produce haemoglobin and healthy
red blood cells properly. That means Chirag
will need blood transfusion for
the rest of his life. In India, every year,
around 10,000 to 15,000 children are diagnosed
with Thalassemia. It&amp;#39;s not surprising
that India is known as the Thalassemia
capital of the world. This is an inherited disease. You have chances of contracting it
only if your ascendants had it. But Thalassemia can increase
the risk of getting cancer. In a 2015 Taiwanese study, it revealed that compared
to the general population, Thalassemia patients are
52% more likely to get cancer. Every three weeks,
when Chirag was taken to the hospital
for a transfusion, he asks his parents, his friends don&amp;#39;t
go to the hospital, so why do his parents take him? &amp;quot; But when Chirag was
about 7-8 years old, he started to
understand somewhat that the issue is within him, which is why he has to go
to the hospital every 3 weeks. With medicine, Chirag started to adjust with the
transfusion procedure. When IV lines would penetrate
his skin, he wouldn&amp;#39;t cry. But the parents felt the pain. Then one day, a doctor
told them about DKMS, a stem cell registry. Now, friends, to
understand cancer, it is important to
understand stem cells. Because stem cells and cancer have a significant link. What are stem cells? You can take a
guess from their name. Stem Cells. These are the cells
that make other cells. They can evolve into
different types of cells. Along with this, stem cells
can even replicate themselves. These are the cells
that make blood cells, skin cells, muscle cells. These cells can repair
damaged tissues. This is why, while treating
blood cancer and blood disorders, stem cells are crucial. At the beginning of pregnancy, when a fertilised egg
becomes a blastocyst, at the early stages before the
embryo develops into a child, the stem cells found
in the blastocyst are called embryonic stem cells. These cells that can become any type of cell
required by the body. But unfortunately,
when humans grow up, adult humans do not
have such stem cells, that can develop
into every kind of cell. The stem cells in adults, also
known as stomatic stem cells, can differentiate
according to the tissues or organs of
the body they are in. For example, the
stem cells in our brain can convert into
brain cells only. The stem cells in our skin can convert into
skin cells only. And the blood stem
cells in our body, can be converted into different
types of blood stem cells. Overall, friends, there are
400 types of cells in our body. Like red blood cells,
white blood cells, nerve cells, fat
cells, skin cells. Look at this research
from September 2023. According to this, the total
number of cells in our body goes into trillions. A young child
has 17 trillion cells. An average adult
female has 28 trillion cells. And an average adult
male has 36 trillion cells. 36,000,000,000,000. Every day, billions of cells die and billions of news
cells are created. Specifically, 330 billion cells, which is around 1% of the
total number of cells in our body, are replaced every day. There is a popular
philosophical saying, &amp;quot;You are not the same
person you were this morning.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You keep on changing
every moment like a river.&amp;quot; This is literally true in
the context of our body. This changing every moment, cells regenerating every day, is done by stem cells. The regeneration
in different tissues is undertaken by the
stem cells of that tissue. But in all this, one organ
of our body is very unique. Our liver. Our liver is a unique organ because in it, fully
developed, fully specialised liver
cells are also divided and can rapidly
increase their number. That means, our liver is
the only organ in our body that acts like a lizard&amp;#39;s tail. If you cut off a lizard&amp;#39;s tail, it can grow again. Similarly, if you cut
off 90% of our liver, it will grow again. But this does not mean that
the liver cannot be damaged. If you say that beer is
not an alcoholic drink, or that wine is
good for your health, or if you are one
of those people who are proud of their
drinking capabilities, drinking alcohol has the
worst effect on the liver and increases the
risk of liver cancer. But not just alcohol, if you keep eating junk food, your weight keeps increasing, keep consuming every
random &amp;quot;herbal&amp;quot; thing, you can get liver problems. In India, every year,
around 270,000 people die due to liver diseases. Which is 18.3% of the global
liver disease-related deaths. But coming back to the topic
of stem cells and regeneration, it is important to
clarify one thing. The various types
of cells in our bodies, the rate of regeneration
of each type is different. Like this major study from
May 2008 has shown that every year, 10% of fat cells
in the body are replaced. This means that to replace
all the fat cells in our body, it takes 10 years. This is an
interesting side topic; Can our brain cells
regenerate too? There has been a scientific
debate on this for a long time. It is believed that most
of the neurons in our brain are formed by the
time of our birth. Approximately
100 billion neurons. But recent research
has indicated that limited neurogenesis, that is, the regeneration
of brain cells, is seen in only two
parts of the brain. One was the hippocampus, which is involved in our
memories, learning, and emotions. And the 2nd is
the olfactory bulb, which is responsible
for smelling. The other neurons of the
brain do not regenerate and remain the
same throughout life. And apart from the brain, our spinal cord,
heart, and joints show very limited
regenerative capacity. This is why if these regions are affected by
diseases or injuries, they can turn fatal. On the contrary, there
are many other body cells, that show rapid regeneration. They are completely
overhauled within a short time. Like our skin cells. Our body sheds 500
million skin cells every day. Do you know what this means? This means that our skin completely regenerates
every 4 weeks. 4 weeks is not even the
fastest regeneration time. The lining in our intestines can regenerate
completely in just 5-7 days. 2 to 3 million red blood cells
can be produced in a second. Their average lifespan
is only 120 days. Stem cells have the potential to replicate themselves
and self-renew. Just think about
how amazing it is that our body constantly tries
to make us as good as new. Constantly
regenerates new cells. This is why if you fall
down and get a scratch, it&amp;#39;s not a big deal because
your skin cells regenerate. If you donate your blood, the blood volume or the plasma
is restored in just 24 hours. The red blood cells
you donate to others, will be replaced
within 4 to 6 weeks. This is all about replenishment,
repair, and regeneration. But what if a cell&amp;#39;s
genes get damaged? If you remember, in
the evolution video, I explained what DNA, genes,
and gene mutations are. You can think of a
gene as a program with a detailed set of
instructions for the cell. If a cell&amp;#39;s genes change
or there is an error, it is called a mutation. And because of this, cell
growth can get disturbed. In such a situation, our
body has some options. There are some
mechanisms in our body which fight against gene damage. Like the P53 tumour
suppressor gene, it is like a security guard. The protein
produced by this gene can repair damaged genes. Similarly, there is a gene
which works like a filter. When a cell gets old or damaged, then the gene gives
it the instruction to die. This process is called
Programmed Cell Death or Apoptosis. The cells are
literally told that their work is done
and they need to die. There are some other genes
that work like a mechanic. They repair damaged genes. So, broadly speaking, if there is any
damage to our cells, our body has
security guard genes, filter genes, and
mechanical genes. These genes can either stop
the growth of the damaged cells, repair damaged cells, or remove them from the body. But the thing is that, what happens if these
genes are damaged? What if the
security guard, filter, or the mechanic gets damaged? Who will take over their work? Unfortunately, no one. This situation is
known as Cancer. If a cell&amp;#39;s gene gets
damaged due to mutation and it starts growing
uncontrollably, then such a cell is
called a Cancer Cell. Cancer cells are
so out of control that they pose a problem to
the normal healthy cells too. These cancer cells
often have the ability to infiltrate other tissues. This is why cancer begins
in a single part of the body, but gradually, if
it is not stopped, it spreads to other
parts of the body. When a cancer cell from one body part spreads to other
parts of the body, this process is
called Metastasis. The normal
functioning of our body gets completely
disrupted because of this. At the end of the video, we&amp;#39;ll
talk about the exact reasons behind such gene damages
and how can we prevent them. Now let&amp;#39;s talk about treatment. The most famous treatment
of cancer is Chemotherapy. The process of killing cancer cells using a powerful chemical. This process is known
as Chemotherapy. The biggest problem
with this process is that though these powerful
chemicals kill the cancer cells along with it, they kill
some good healthy cells too. Chemotherapy chemicals
target those cells which are in the middle
of the process of division. So, the fast-regenerating
healthy cells of the body are also attacked along
with the cancer cells. This is why people who are
undergoing chemotherapy often become bald. Because our hair follicle
cells are fast-regrowing cells. Also, as I said that the cells in our intestines
regrow rapidly. So during chemotherapy,
there are digestive problems, like vomiting and diarrhoea. Apart from this, our bone
marrow cells are also destroyed. Bone marrow is the soft
spongy tissue found in our bones. One is the yellow bone marrow, where the stem cells turn
into fat, cartilage, or bone cells. Then there is the
red bone marrow, the blood stem cells that turn into red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. As I said, our blood cells
are fast regrowing cells, so they get damaged
due to chemotherapy. Anaemia can occur due to
the lack of red blood cells. Haemoglobin level often drops. Platelets help
in blood clotting. When we get hurt
or have a wound, they come and heal that wound. But if we have
insufficient platelets, it will lead to
excessive bleeding. White blood cells
help with our immunity. If we catch a cold,
they help us fight back. But because of chemotherapy, if there are insufficient
white blood cells, the chances of contracting other diseases increase significantly. That is why doctors suggest that during chemotherapy, the patient needs a balanced,
nutritious diet. They need to sleep well, stay away from stress, wash hands
regularly, wear masks, use good hygiene to avoid
bacterial and viral infections regular exercise
becomes very important. During Bollywood actor
Sanjay Dutt&amp;#39;s cancer treatment, his oncologist
Dr. Sewanti Limaye said that even on the days
when he received chemotherapy, he could be found
exercising on a treadmill. He used to exercise for an hour. Maybe that&amp;#39;s why he
could recover so well. Now, let&amp;#39;s assume that cancer
cells die due to chemotherapy. But the question is, the healthy blood cells that
have been destroyed, how can that be restored? For this, we need a
stem cell transplant. Also known as the
bone marrow transplant. This is a treatment
option for patients with blood cancer
and blood disorders. In some cases, the patient is given their own
healthy stem cells. Such cases are known as
Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. From an arm, the
patient&amp;#39;s blood is withdrawn and sent to
an apheresis machine, the stem cells
are separated in it, and the remaining blood is
returned via the other arm. Cancer cells are eliminated
with chemotherapy and then the stem
cells are returned. In many cases,
another donor is needed because the patient&amp;#39;s body does not have
enough bone marrow. There aren&amp;#39;t many
healthy blood cells. Such cases are known as
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant. Just like it is
necessary to match the blood group for receiving
someone&amp;#39;s blood, similarly, when receiving
someone&amp;#39;s stem cells, the HLA Typing needs to match. The Human Leukocyte
Antigen Typing. Without going into
too much detail, know that HLA is an important
part of the immune system. The probability of
a perfect HLA typing match with your
siblings is only 25%. It can never match your parents, because one part of it comes
from one of your parents, and the other from
the other parent. So if there is no match
with your siblings, then you have to
get an HLA typing matched with an
unrelated person. And the chance of getting
a perfect match is very low. 1 out of 100,000. In the world, for every 100,000 people, there will
be only one person with whom your
HLA type will match. So how can one find
matching donors in such cases? Friends, here comes the
role of the Stem Cell Registry, DKMS. This is a global
non-profit organisation whose tagline is &amp;#39;We
Delete Blood Cancer.&amp;#39; They have created a
worldwide database. From this database, a
donor was found for Chirag. Chirag, whose story I told you at the beginning of this video. This donor was Roman Semenskiy, he is natively from Russia, and has been settled
in Germany since 2005. Roman is a precision mechanic but likes to do kickboxing. Once his kickboxing
team donated blood. Roman has also been donating
blood since his school days, so he joined them. They were asked if they would
like to give a swab sample. A swab sample is taken
from the inside of the cheek. Roman agreed to it. About a year after
giving his swab sample, DKMS contacted Roman. He was told that his HLA
typing matched someone. He was eligible to
donate his stem cells. For Roman, knowing about
the recipient was not important. Rather, the only
important fact was that, his donation would
save someone&amp;#39;s life. He agreed to it and donated
his stem cells to Chirag. Apart from our bone
marrow, stem cells are found in our
peripheral blood too. That is, the blood
running in our heart, arteries,
veins, and capillaries. Stem cell donation might
sound like a major procedure, but it&amp;#39;s actually a simple
procedure of 3-4 hours. To donate stem cells, you just have to go to the
nearest centre. and the rest of
the process is as simple as blood
platelet donation. The only difference is that when your blood is
taken out via your arm, the blood is first
sent to a machine where the stem
cells are separated. And then the blood is
sent back to your body. Basically, only the
stem cells are taken. And the blood content
is returned to your body. This process is called PBSC, Peripheral Blood
Stem Cell Method. And as we know, stem cells can
regenerate themselves, so after some time,
the body can easily regenerate the stem cells. Similarly, Roman saved Chirag&amp;#39;s life through stem cell donation. Chirag could then
be completely healthy. After Chirag recovered,
he wrote a letter to Roman, which brought Roman
and his wife to tears. In his letter, Chirag called
Roman his brother and a hero. Roman said that he
has a younger brother, who is actually the
same age as Chirag. This year, in May, the
two met for the first time. Friends, you too can save
someone&amp;#39;s life like this. You can become a
godsend for someone. If all the viewers of
this video register, we can fight blood cancer. I hope that none of you have
blood cancer or blood disorder, and may you never contract it. But you can still find
out your HLA Typing. It might help
someone if you do so. Click on the link in
the description or the pinned comment to
get to the online form. Fill in your basic
details in the form, like your name,
age, and address. Within a few
days of registering, you will receive
a free swab kit. You will get 3 clean
sterilised buccal swabs, buccal swab envelope, consent form and
an instruction sheet. You would need to follow the instructions on the
instruction sheet, to take your swab sample. Basically, you would need
to rub your inner cheek with it. Sign the consent
form and place the it with the sample form
in the given envelope. and then request
a reverse pickup using the method
shown on the screen. Your sample will be used
to identify your HLA Type, And the entire process
would take about 40 days. After this, you will receive
an email from DKMS, on successfully registering with the World Stem
Cell Donor database. If you want to
know your HLA type, you can email
donor@dkms-bmst.org. If your HLA type matches
with a blood cancer patient, you will get a call
for stem cell donation. The possibility of
getting a call is very low. It may take a week
to a year to get a call. Or you may never get any call. If no one needs your HLA type. But if you get a
call for a donation, it would be up to you whether you are comfortable
with the donation or not. This is a voluntary process. At that moment, you can decide whether you want to
donate your stem cells or not. But the entire process
is completely free. You don&amp;#39;t need
to pay for any of it. The DKMS NGO bears all costs. Now let&amp;#39;s come to the
reasons for gene damage. What do some cells
get gene damage? There are 3 main reasons. The first is Inherited Mutation. If you are born
with a mutated gene. This usually happens
when you inherit a damaged gene
from your parents. In some cases, it
can also happen if the mutated gene developed
while you were an embryo. Out of the total cancer
cases in the world, 5-10% of the cases are due
to inherited mutated genes. That means that these genes were with the patient
since they were born. The second reason is age. With age, the genes
start to wear out. That&amp;#39;s why there are more
cancer cases in elderly people. Look at this report from
Cancer Research UK. The cancer cases between
2017 to 2019 were studied, 90% of these cases, were in people aged 50 or more. With age how many people
out of 100,000 will have cancer? You can see this
incidence in this graph. You can see the curve going up. And the maximum incidence is seen in the interval
of 85 to 89 years. That means the most chance of getting cancer is
at the age of 80-90. This is because gene damage
keeps building up with time. A person may die young due to other factors like
dengue or malaria, or they live a long life to end up as a cancer patient. This is why cancer is
seen more in developed countries compared
to developing countries, because in developed countries the incidence of
other diseases is low. People live longer and if they live longer then the risk of gene
damage increases. So, unfortunately, the two
reasons I have told you till now, nothing can be done
about either of them. The genes you inherited, are already in you. You can&amp;#39;t change anything now. And you will continue to
age as long as your live, you can&amp;#39;t stop it. But the third reason, we can do a lot about it. These are lifestyle causes. Look at the 2017 analysis by
the American Cancer Society. The good news is that 42% of cancer
cases are preventable because they are cause
due to lifestyle factors. 19% of cancer cases
all over the world, are because of smoking. 5.6% are due to alcohol. So it is absolutely clear that alcohol and smoking should
never be a part of your life. Second, if you are
overweight or obese, get your weight
in the right zone. Because look at this, 7.8% of cancer cases
are due to obesity. How can you reduce your weight? If you want a detailed
scientific guide for this, then I have made this video, with a detailed,
step-by-step approach, which explains exactly
how you can do it. Third: UV radiation, around 4.7% of cases
are due to UV radiation. The harmful ultraviolet
rays of the sun. In the afternoon, check the
UV index on your weather app. If it is higher than 5, then the ultraviolet rays
can be damaging to your skin. The ultraviolet rays penetrate your skin
and damage your DNA. They damage the genes which then leads to skin cancer. Tanning or getting
sunburnt repeatedly is a sign of UV radiation. And it is very harmful. There are two ways to avoid it. First, don&amp;#39;t go out in the
sun from 10 am to 4 pm. During this time the
UV index is the highest, especially in the summer. It&amp;#39;s not as high in the winter. So, enjoy the sun in the
early morning or late evening. And second, if you actually want to go out in the
sun during this time, it is important to
wear sunscreen. Fourth, around 5%
of all cancer cases are due to physical
inactivity and poor diet. Remove processed food
and added sugar from your diet and include different types
of colourful vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, herbs,
whole grains, beans, milk, eggs, etc. Packaged food often
contains such chemicals that are carcinogenic and increase the risk
of getting cancer. But often these things are
discovered after a long time. Like in the bread
video, I talked about potassium bromate, a famous additive
which was added to bread and how it was used for a
long time all over the world and it was discovered
only in the last 10-20 years that it is actually
carcinogenic. The bread manufacturers promised that they won&amp;#39;t
use it going forward. But what about
what you ate till now? After Tamil Nadu and Goa, Karnataka has now banned
artificial food colouring. It was seen that in
kababs the colours Sunset Yellow and
Carmoisine were being used. Sunset Yellow is a chemical that when used in the European Union, comes with a label on the packet with a health warning
related to children. On the CSPI website, you will find a long
list of such chemicals that were previously permitted, but were later
banned by the USA. Like in 2018, styrene, myrcene, and
benzophenone were banned. So the safest option is
to not eat packaged food, and to eat natural
food, fresh food, at local places. Physical activity and an
active lifestyle is important. Keep doing regular exercise, which includes stretching,
cardio, and strength training, all three forms of exercises. Stretching is very obvious, in which you
stretch your muscles. Cardio means the exercises
like running or swimming where your heart beats increases and strength training
done by lifting weights. Then comes the angle of
environmental exposure, air pollution and
many pesticides which are used despite
being carcinogens. In your working
environment, is benzene, asbestos, vinyl chloride
or arsenic being used? Because according
to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, all of these fall under the
category of human carcinogens. Cancer can be caused by the exposure to pesticides
and fertilisers. You can&amp;#39;t control air pollution, but you limit your exposure
as much as possible. Then comes another major factor, which, especially in
developing countries, is responsible for 20-25%
of the cancer cases. Viruses. That&amp;#39;s right. Different types of viruses
can also cause cancer. Like the Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, HIV virus, Human Herpes virus, Human T Lymphotropic virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, HPV virus. There is a simple solution to
protect yourself against these, take the vaccines
recommended by the doctor. Get the vaccine for Hepatitis B, the Hepatitis C vaccine. Often, these vaccines
are given in childhood. The HPV vaccine is new. It is necessary to
get this vaccine to protect yourself
from the HPV virus. So, friends, keep these in mind. If you follow these
points properly, it will reduce the
risk of cancer for you and your family
to a great extent. And I told you how
we can help the patients suffering
from blood cancer. Go and register with DKMS today. The link is in the
description below. By doing this, you can give hope to millions of blood
cancer patients. September is also called
Blood Cancer Awareness Month. This is why I made
this video in September. And now, if you want to know the real secret of the people
who live long, healthy lives, and what can you
learn from such people, I have explained
it in this video. &amp;quot;World&amp;#39;s Oldest Humans&amp;quot; You can click here to watch it. Thank you very much!

hey guys it&amp;#39;s medical system fictionalist where medicine makes perfect sense and today we will talk about the basics of cancer with the mnemonic this is a lovely introduction to the subject of oncology or pathology or oncopathology the word cancer is synonymous with a malignant tumor if you&amp;#39;re on my discussion about other cancers i have videos about these here on my channel especially in my hematology oncology playlist there are no solutions in life there are only incremental trade-offs hey miracles is a growth a good thing well it depends there are no solutions only trade-offs a growth in an embryo usually provides embryogenesis organogenesis this is basically the entire embryo an embryo who&amp;#39;s not growing is not gonna make it when you injure your tissue growth can provide healing and regeneration but don&amp;#39;t forget that cancer is also growth and this can kill you remember this for your next corporate meeting where you discuss quote growth strategies well sometimes the company grows and it&amp;#39;s beautiful but sometimes they grow like cancer harm other people outgrow their blood supply until they suffocate just like malignant neoplasia so what is cancer first we have many types of cell growth could be hypertrophy hyperplasia metaplasia dysplasia neoplasia hypertrophy is increase in the size of the cell hyperplasias increase the number of the cell metaplasia is when you change one type of tissue to another type of tissue in the same category of tissues from epithelium to another epithelium or from connective to another connective tissue but epithelium cannot jump to connective tissue dysplasia is this means abnormal difficult etc so this is abnormal growth dysfunctional growth it&amp;#39;s weird because this might turn into neoplasia neoplasia is the same as tumors and tumors could be benign or malignant definition of neoplage abnormal mass of tissue whose growth exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of normal tissue and it persists even after the cessation of the stimulus that caused the growth in the first place cancers are weird tumors the same as neoplasia is the same as any word that ends in oma except oklahoma malignant tumors are the same as cancers so cancers could be carcinomas or circums carcinoma is a cancer of epithelial tissue sarcoma is cancer of connective tissue when carcinomas metastasize they prefer to go to the lymph first when sarcomas metastasize they prefer the blood are cancer is monoclonal or polyclonal it could be either but let&amp;#39;s just for simplicity sake say that cancers are monoclonal what does monoclonal mean it means that the disaster started in one crazy cell just one stupid abnormal malignant mutant cell is what started everything example look at this all right so i had three to one three kappa to one lambda this is normal okay i got some infection so as a normal response to that infection i increased okay but i preserved the ratio because this is follicle increase the cap has increased the lamb does increase everything increased proportionately this is awesome this is normal this is what you expect but look at cancer here is the normal ratio here is the ratio when you have basal lymphoma oh my goodness what&amp;#39;s that what the flip is that only one crazy cell decided to grow and multiply and divide like mad cancer is growth with no control growth with no limit growth with no evidence caused that&amp;#39;s why if you&amp;#39;re honest don&amp;#39;t say x causes cancer say x may be a risk factor for cancer correlation is not the same as causation also morality is not causality just because you hate something doesn&amp;#39;t mean it causes cancer cancer serves no useful function it arises from any type of cells it could be an unfunctioning most of them don&amp;#39;t serve a function or it could be something in the sense that they secrete something this can happen with endocrine tumors and it can happen with perineoplastic syndromes hemorrhages why don&amp;#39;t we have a cure for cancer on hearing that a new yorker is hit by a car once every 30 minutes the listener replied gee he must get awfully tired of that as dr thomas soul illustrates why is this fallacious because a new yorker is a statistical category not a singular individual similarly cancer is a statistical pathological category it&amp;#39;s not one disease miracles why don&amp;#39;t we have a cure for cancer which cancer are you talking about because if you&amp;#39;re talking about basal cell carcinoma which is a cancer of the skin basically you go to the doctor twice once you diagnose it wants to remove it with excisional biopsy that&amp;#39;s it and for me that&amp;#39;s a cure for cancer cml oh imatinib it works in something like 95 percent of cases where i grew up we call this a cure many types of all have occurred combination chemotherapy it works in something also great like 97 percent of cases hodgkin&amp;#39;s lymphoma has a cure it&amp;#39;s called abvd i&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s going to work for 100 of people but it works in most of them moreover most stage 1 cancers they are cancers have a cure just remove them when they are still small and removable but to be fair other cancers don&amp;#39;t have a cure we don&amp;#39;t have a cure for pancreatic cancer for example it&amp;#39;s an evil cancer this can kill you in a matter of six months benign tumors are here malignant tumors are here malignant tumors these are the cancers cancers are not capsulated cancers might have a false capsule but that&amp;#39;s not a true capsule this is not a biological membrane that belongs to the cancer cancers can have hemorrhage and necrosis cancers under the microscope have criteria of malignancies the cells are variable irregular in size and shape the nucleus is weird and pleiomorphic irregular variable etc hyperchromatic nucleus the nucleus is dark there is increased nucleus cytoplasmic ratio the nucleolus is big and also dark benign tumors care for their neighbors they care about the surrounding structure but cancer doesn&amp;#39;t care there is loss of polarity here is a small cell small cell small so no i&amp;#39;m gonna destroy all of you i don&amp;#39;t care how you look i&amp;#39;m gonna destroy you if i have a benign tumor and i removed it it&amp;#39;s not gonna come back but if i have cancer and i remove it it can come back benign tumors are usually not dangerous with some exceptions but cancers are dangerous they can kill you i&amp;#39;m not saying they will 100 kill you some people get therapy some patients will see their tumors disappear and regress on its own with no intervention whether they follow a plant-based diet or they eat like a pig cancer resolution and regression is one of the poorly understood phenomena but hybridicosus my professor told me that the reason this happens is because the cancer outgrew its blood supply or got destroyed by the immune system okay that&amp;#39;s true but why did this happen in few people and not most of them that&amp;#39;s the question i&amp;#39;m not asking about the how i&amp;#39;m asking about the why how cancer kills people anemia cachexia organ destruction metastasis obstruction of organs tubes canals ducts ventricles etc and it can secrete some stuff and we call this paraneoplastic syndrome the stuff secreted by the cancer can kill you how do you manage cancer don&amp;#39;t forget few cancers resolve on their own no clue why with cancers you can watch and wait you can do surgery radiation chemotherapy or blood separation or apheresis in some blood cancers called leukemias here is a very short list of people who had pancreatic cancer and now to the mnemonic the mnemonic for cancer cancer is malignant well no duh thank you captain obvious cancer is mad rapid cell division cancer is myopic usually monoclonal one crazy cell cancer can metastasize we call these secondaries so the original cancer is called the primary okay let&amp;#39;s say i had lung cancer that&amp;#39;s your primary cancer this lung cancer metastasized to the brain whatever is in the brain now is called secondary secondary to what secondary to the primary in your lung cancer is meticulous cancer has preferences called cancer predilection example breast cancer loves to metastasize to bones prostate cancer also loves to metastasize to bones lung cancer likes to go to the brain colon cancer loves to metastasize to the liver this is called cancer predilection even cancers are not random in many cases there is a pattern to be studied hence oncology hence pathology cancer is mannerless example suppose that i have a type of leukemia okay this will lead to an increase in one type of my white blood cells everything else is gonna be sacrificed the bone marrow is gonna stop making red blood cells anemia it&amp;#39;s gonna stop making platelets thrombocytopenia oh so we&amp;#39;re only focusing on one stupid type of one stupid white blood cells everything else is suffering that&amp;#39;s true cancer crowds out other cells loss of polarity cancer eats other people&amp;#39;s food cancer can mimic example small cell lung cancer secrete acth in that sense lung cancer is mimicking the anterior pituitary gland the same stupid cancer can also secrete adh antidiuretic hormone in this sense this cancer is mimicking the hypothalamus cancer mmm we love sugar that&amp;#39;s why cancers shine on pet scans positron emission tomography you&amp;#39;ll find the cancer shining greater than the rest of the tissue because it&amp;#39;s eating sugar cancer grows with no limits in math we call this exponential or geometrical growth until your cancer becomes a mammoth even then it might not stop in some cases it might stop if it outgrows its blood supply or if your immune system decides to wake up and kill the stupid thing hey miracles quick question i read on a blog that every day we have cancers in our body and the immune system kills all of those cancers every day shut up every day you have mutations but you&amp;#39;re not having cancers every day cancer is a mess by definition so you&amp;#39;re saying that every day i have a mass in my body like on my skin and i don&amp;#39;t see it and then it goes away shut up every day i have mutations and these mutations get stopped remember the cell cycle checkpoints remember your dna proofreading mechanisms remember your lymphocytes when all of this fails and i develop ems this is cancer next cancer is magical there is no evident cause we have risk factors correlation is not causation so don&amp;#39;t say x causes cancer the only exception if you say smoking causes cancer i&amp;#39;m not gonna yell at you but with anything else we don&amp;#39;t have enough evidence to prove causation it&amp;#39;s all about correlation next cancer is amorphous which means irregular cancer is manipulative it&amp;#39;s evading your immune system cancer likes amnesty it stays in your body it&amp;#39;s uninvited we don&amp;#39;t want it i&amp;#39;m gonna stay here against the will of your immune system cancer could be manageable or it could be malicious if cancer is malicious or malevolent how does it kill us cachexia anemia and other techniques if cancer causes chronic inflammation which can happen is secondary amyladosis don&amp;#39;t forget that cancer is not the same as carcinoid the word oid means like carcinoid is cancer-like this is the meaning of the word okay miracles so is this benign or malignant well you have to send the sample to a pathologist and the pathologist will tell you but the word does not imply can&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s the point these were the basics of cancer pathology if you
